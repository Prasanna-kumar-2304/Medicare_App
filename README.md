Medicare App
"Your Health, Your Way — Anytime, Anywhere"

📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI Magic with Groq

Healthcare access is still limited in many regions due to long waiting times, lack of connectivity to good doctors, and a shortage of reliable online health consultation platforms. By using Groq's AI capabilities, we aimed to create a solution that bridges the gap between patients and healthcare services using a fast, responsive, and smart digital assistant.

🎯 Objective
The Medicare App aims to simplify and modernize healthcare services by offering:

Seamless doctor appointment booking,

AI-driven medicinal guidance,

On-demand medicine ordering, and

Real-time video consultations with healthcare professionals.

Our goal is to serve people who struggle to access medical support easily, providing them with a reliable, fast, and user-friendly platform that ensures better health outcomes from the comfort of their homes.

Our Approach:
We selected this problem because we saw a strong need for accessible and intelligent healthcare services.

We began by brainstorming key pain points users face with traditional healthcare apps.

Our main focus was speed, reliability, and intelligent user assistance.

One major challenge was integrating a smart medicinal chatbot that doesn't just respond but understands user queries. Using Groq made it possible to achieve fast, context-aware replies.

A breakthrough moment was when we successfully implemented real-time video consultation using Socket.io and optimized streaming for smooth doctor-patient communication even on lower bandwidths.
